Project Deliverables: 

1) Create and remove users from Microsoft Entra ID accounts 

2) Azure elements to implement (bare minimum for prototype): 
Users: Bishop, Stake President, EQP, RSP, and regular members 

3) Resource groups:
cp-ysa1 (first resource group for the admin)
cp-ysa2 (second resource group for the members) 

4) ARM templates:
Parameter file for Member IDs (random generated according to LDS tools format) 
Template JSON file for resource creation and configuration 

5) VMs:
vm-ward1: VM for resource management for the bishopric 
vm-ward2: VM for resource management for regular members 

6) NSG: Network security groups:
ward-nsg: Network security group added for Ward services 
bishoporic-nsg: Network security group for bishopric members 

7) Virtual network: 
ward-vnet: Singular Virtual Network running on port 80 with RDP allowed and other protocols (TCP/DNS/web) denied 
PowerShell commands to invoke the web request and start an executable process ward-app.exe file

8) Web Apps:
At least one of Azure Service Container or Azure Kubernetes Service (ACS or AKS) 
Optional: Bicep templates for ARM conversion (usually used when Bicep use case is needed) 
Optional II: Azure functions with a Python function to simply check for duplicates in Ward member IDs 

9) Add in storage volumes for the Temple Recommends and Ward callings 
Use Azure Virtual Network, subnet, and RBAC to build a virtual machine Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution 
Monitor and implement alerts with Azure Monitor 
Govern the policy of each resource with ARM Templates / Bicep file 

10) Finally, demo the end solution.
